Need to create a cluster profile through matlab GUI
(This can be done on aci-i)

Creating Torque profile from "Manage Cluster Profiles"
1) Press Add ("+" mark) -> Custom -> Torque
2) Press "Edit" button on the right bottom of the window
3) Go to the bottom of the activated window
4) Type ssh on the second from the bottom box
   (Remote shell command to call on UNIX when running communicating jobs)
5) Type scp on the last box
   (Remote copy command for non-shared file systems)

(Name of the profile can be changed from the Cluster Profile box on the left)

Once done, launch matlab on text mode and run matlab program (without .m):
$ module load matlab
$ matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r <Script Name>

Screen/tmux session may be used to submit job and kept Matlab stay alive.(Optional)
Regarding screen/tmux session, please ssh to same node: $ ssh PSUID@ 146.186.1.23

Requested resource can be easily changed but last number on the following line
must be smaller than total number of processors:

jj = batch(Cluster, 'testpar','pool',19);

(i.e. 19 if 20 processors are requested, or total # proc - 1)

########## Sample submission command ##########
$ module load matlab
$ matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r cluster_test
