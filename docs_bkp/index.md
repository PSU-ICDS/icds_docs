# Overview

Computational and data sciences are a fast growing mode of discovery, in addition to traditional theory and experiment, because they provides a unique virtual laboratory to investigate complex problems that are otherwise impossible or impractical to address. Such problems can range from understanding the physics of the origins of the universe, the genomic/molecular basis of disease, or the socioeconomic impacts of a digital society; to designing smart structures and nanoscale tailored materials; or to developing systems for clean energy or realtime responses to threats. The intellectual strength of computational science lies with its universality â€“ all research domains benefit from it. The expectation is that The Institute for Computational and Data Sciences will succeed both in facilitating research across a broad spectrum of disciplines and in securing significant external resources for cyberscience-related research for years to come.

## 1.1 Who is ICDS?

### 1.1.1 Our Mission

The mission of the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences is to build capacity to solve problems of scientific and societal importance through cyber-enabled research. As computation and data science become increasingly vital modes of inquiry, we enable researchers to develop innovative computational methods and to apply those methods to research challenges. Specifically, we:

*   foster a collaborative, interdisciplinary scholarly community focused on the development and application of innovative computational methods;
*   expand participation in interdisciplinary research through strategic investments and effective outreach;  
    and
*   provide a vibrant world-class cyberinfrastructure by maintaining and continually improving hardware and software solutions and technical expertise.

### 1.1.2 Our Vision

ICDS will expand its role as an international leader in advancing cyberinfrastructure along with computational and data-driven methods and in driving their application to interdisciplinary research. We will use our expertise coupled with our state-of-the-science research infrastructure to support cyber-enabled interdisciplinary collaborations and attract the worlds best researchers. These researchers will form a vibrant intellectual community empowered to use the latest and most effective computational methods to make transformative discoveries for science and society.

## 1.2 What is Roar?

The Roar supercomputer (formerly known as the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Advanced CyberInfrastructure, or ICDS-ACI) is our high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The name also refers to the services associated with this system. Roar provides secure, high-quality advanced computing and storage resources to the Penn State research community.

### 1.2.2 What does Roar do?

Roar contributes to the ICDS mission by providing researchers with the hardware, software, and technical expertise needed to solve problems of scientific and societal importance. Roar provides a variety of services, including operations, backup, technical consulting, and training. It offers over 1000 servers with more than 23,000 processing cores, 6 Petabytes (PB) of disk parallel file storage, 12 PB of tape archive storage, high-speed Ethernet and Infiniband interconnects, and a large software stack. Roar is also compliant with specific NIH and NIST security controls.

### 1.2.3 Roar History

In 2011 Penn State established an intra-university Cyberscience Task-Force to develop a strategic and coherent vision for cyberscience at the university. On the recommendations of this task-force, the Institute for CyberScience was established in 2012\. ICDS is one of seven interdisciplinary research institutes under the Office of the Senior Vice President for Research. Peer institutes include the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, the Materials Research Institute, the Institutes of Energy and the Environment, the Social Science Research Institute, the Cancer Research Institute, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute.  

Under its first director, Padma Raghavan, the institute began a cluster hiring initiative in 2012-2013, in partnership with Penn State colleges and institutes. This initiative, the [ICDS Co-hire program](https://www.icds.psu.edu/about/icds-co-hires/), brought in promising computational experts from a range of fields.  

In 2014 Executive Vice President and Provost Nick Jones and Vice President for Research Neil Sharkey initiated a series of steps designed to help Penn State deliver the broad spectrum of computing and data services that are required to advance research. As part of this ongoing process, ICDS continues to develop and sustain advanced cyberinfrastructure, with the goal of accelerating research outcomes by enhancing researcher productivity. In 2019, the institute was renamed to be the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. In 2020, the supercomputer (formerly named the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Advanced Cyber Infrastructure, or ICDS-ACI) was renamed Roar.
