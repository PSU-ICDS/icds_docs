By requesting a Roar user account, users acknowledge that they have read and understood all Roar and applicable Pennsylvania State University policies and agree to abide by said policies. All policies can be found at our [policies page](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/icds-aci-policies/).  

#### 10.1 Authentication and Access Control

This policy serves to manage the lifecycle of accounts created under the current state and configuration of Roar. It specifies criteria for creating a user account, using an account, and termination of a user account.

#### 10.2 Data Protection and Retention

This policy outlines the protection of data that is created, collected or manipulated by personnel that fall within the scope of Roar and applies to any person who uses Roar resources or handles data managed by Roar. It specifies data retention policies and resources, as well as the responsibilities of the principal investigator, the University, and Roar.  

#### 10.3 Software Acceptable Use

This policy explains how software is introduced, installed, and maintained on the Roar computer system. The policy details how users can install their own software in their user or group spaces, as well as how ICDS will regularly update the Roar software stack. Information on how to request new software for the Roar software stack is included. The policy also discusses who is responsible for licensing and usage agreements in various circumstances, and the rights that ICDS reserves to make changes to installed software in order to keep Roar systems safe, up-to-date, and in compliance with University and government regulations.  
  

#### 10.4 SLA Terms and Conditions

This terms and conditions document outlines the basic provisions that guide the working relationships between researchers and Roar.

title: System Access
---

The Roar systems are available for all users with Penn State access. Non-Penn State members who are collaborating with Penn State researchers are able to get a Penn State SLIM access account and then sign up for a Roar account.

  

#### 4.1 Sponsorship

Each non-faculty member signing up for an account must have a sponsor. This is typically the adviser or course instructor. The request requires the Penn State username and not an alias. The [Penn State directory](http://www.work.psu.edu/ldap/) can be used to figure out the username if only another email alias is known.  

  

#### 4.2 Permissions to use Resources

The users who have access to an allocation are placed in an allocation group. Users can see all of the groups they are in by using the `id` command.

To gain access to an allocation or a group storage, have the PI send an email to the i-ASK Center ([iask@ics.psu.edu](mailto:iask@ics.psu.edu)) stating the user IDs (ex. abc123) and the allocation(s) and group storage(s) you wish to add them to. This explicit permission must be granted before users are allowed access.  

  

#### 4.3 Getting an Account

Users with a Penn State ID can sign up for an account using: [<span class="cmtt-10">https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu</span>](https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu)  

Faculty member accounts require no sponsorship. Students and staff require a faculty sponsor, which must be listed by their original Penn State ID, rather than by an alias. The sponsor will get an email stating they were listed as a sponsor. The faculty member can respond to the iAsk center ([<span class="cmtt-10">iAsk@ics.psu.edu</span>](mailto:iAsk@ics.psu.edu)) with either explicit approval or a denial. If no denial is given, the student or staff member will be granted implicit approval after two business days. Faculty members can send an email with multiple users if they will be sponsoring multiple accounts, such as for a class project. After an account has been approved, it can take up to twenty-four hours before the system updates and the user is able to login.  

Users who do not have Penn State ID but are collaborators from other institutions need to acquire a Penn State SLIM account before they sign up for a Roar account and Duo. To request SLIM account, please follow these [instructions](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/).  

You will need to wait for your SLIM access account to be created before you can proceed to request your Roar account or sign up for two-factor authentication.
