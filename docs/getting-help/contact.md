# Contacting ICDS Support

If you need help using Roar (RC or RR), please submit your support request **one of the following ways**:

- **Email**: <icds@psu.edu>
- **Service Portal**: [Submit a ticket via ServiceNow](https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=dd1c98f11b57e510bd31ed74bd4bcb1a)
- **Support Ticket** : Submit through the Roar portal

Our team of HPC experts will respond as quickly as possible.

**Important**: In your request, **clearly state which Roar resource** your issue concerns:
- Roar Collab (RC)
- Roar Restricted (RR)

This helps us route your request to the right specialist and resolve it faster.

**Never** email staff members directly. Using the official channels ensures:
- Your request is tracked
- It’s visible to the entire support team
- Someone is always available to pick it up (even if individual staff are part-time)
