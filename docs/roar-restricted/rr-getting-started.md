# Roar Restricted

Roar Restricted (RR) is intended for working with restricted data.
Group storage on RR is provided on an as-needed basis 
to principal investigators (PIs) who work with restricted data,
and must comply with more stringent data storage standards.

Most material in the User Guide 
applies to both Roar Collab (RC) and RR.
This addendum addresses items unique to RR.

## Compute hardware

Roar Restricted consists of two different partitions:

| Resource | Cores | Memory (GB) | CPU | GPU | Network | Count |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Standard | 48 <br> 24 | 384 <br> 256 | Gold 6248R <br> E5-2680v3 | | Infiniband | 12 <br> 48 |
| GPU | 28 | 256 | E5-2680v4 | quad P100 | Infiniband | 3 |


## Accessing

To request an account on RR, a user must complete the 
[Account Request](https://accounts.hpc.psu.edu) form, 
and email <icds@psu.edu> to request a RR account.
The email should include the user's access ID, 
and the restricted storage owner's name and access ID.
Non-faculty accounts require approval from a PI sponsor. 

Before granting accessing RR, the user will be assigned to complete the RR training module
via [Penn State LRN](https://lrn.psu.edu).

This training is required by the Office of Information Security (OIS) 
to maintain compliance with the Authority to Operate (ATO).

## Connecting

To access RR, users must have a paid compute or storage allocation.

Users can connect to RR only via the [Roar Restricted Portal](<https://rrportal.hpc.psu.edu>).
The RR Portal can only be accessed from within the Penn State network or using the 
[Penn State GlobalProtect VPN](https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0013431&sys_kb_id=24f7cdd9dbd7e0d02c4f9e74f3961967&spa=1).
