title: Data Transfer and Storage
---

There are many different ways to transfer data to and from ICDS storage locations.
The characteristics of your data and desired workflow will dictate which solution 
would be best.

# Data Storage Locations and Quotas

ICDS offers three tiers of storage: free, Active, and Nearline. All users of ICDS
are eligible to the free tier including `home`, `work`, and `scratch` directories.
Extended storage solutions such as Actie or Nearline are available to users with 
paid allocations.

There are several file storage options for users, each with their own quotas and 
retention policies. These are available for users to optimize for specific purposes.

Please note that while both Roar and Roar Collab have similar file storage 
locations, **each cluster has independent file systems and files cannot be accessed 
between them**. Information on transferring files between Roar, Roar Collab, 
and Nearline storage can be found in [Transferring Data to and between ICDS 
resources](#transfer).

|Storage|Quota|Backup Policy|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Home|16 GB  
500,000 files|Daily snapshot|
|Work|128 GB  
1 million files|Daily snapshot|
|Scratch|No space quota  
1 million files|No backup  
Files purged after 30 days|
|Group|Allocation dependent|No backup|
|Nearline|Allocation dependent|No backup|

Group storage directories are created when an active storage allocation is 
established. If you are interested in setting up a storage or compute allocation, 
please contact us at [icds@psu.edu](mailto:icds@psu.edu) for more information.


## Roar Storage Locations

|Storage|Location|
|--- |--- |
|Home|`/storage/home/<user_id>`|
|Work|`/storage/work/<user_id>`|
|Scratch|`/scratch/<user_id>`|
|Group|`/storage/group/<PI_id>/default`|

## Roar Collab Storage Locations

|Storage|Location|
|--- |--- |
|Home|`/storage/home/<user_id>`|
|Work|`/storage/work/<user_id>`|
|Scratch|`/gpfs/scratch/<user_id>`|
|Group|`/gpfs/group/<PI_id>/default`|

## Nearline Archival Storage

Nearline storage is only accessable from the Roar Data Management nodes.


## Data Management Nodes

To transfer data both within Roar and between Roar and other systems, please 
utilize the Data Management nodes as they have been optimized for effiecent data 
transfer.

The Data Management nodes can be accessed by connecting to host:

`datamgr.aci.ics.psu.edu`

For robust and secure data transfers, we recommend using [Globus](#globus).

However, for **active storage**, [command line file-transfer tools](#cli-transfer), 
such as `rsync`, `sftp` or `scp`, and [graphical tools](gui-transfer) such WinSCP, 
or FileZilla can also be used.
  
**Important:** Do not use tools that attempt to mirror or replicate directory and 
file trees (such as rsync) **into archive storage**. Using such tools with archive 
storage can result in system degradations that negatively impact all users of our 
shared system.

# Transferring Data to, from, and between ICDS Resources

Use of traditional remote file transfer tools such as [Command Line Tools] 
and [drag and drop applications](#gui-transfer) are supported. Additionally, 
ICDS offers [Globus optimized Endpoints](#globus). Globus is a robust data 
transfer service and is the recommended solution for large scale data transfers.

To use other specialized data-transfer software, such as Aspera. [Contact our 
iASK Support Team](mailto: iask@ics.psu.edu) for additional information and 
assistance.

## Command Line Tools

There are several command-line tools that can be used to transfer files. The 
common of these are `scp`, `sftp`, and `rsync`. Basic usage of these commands 
follows, but users are encouraged to [read the man file on these tools]
(https://itsfoss.com/linux-man-page-guide/) for more
details.

### scp

The secure copy utility or `scp` can be used to transfer files between local and 
remote resources. The basic `scp` syntax is:

	$ scp <source user_name>@<source hostname>:<path to file(s)> 
	<target user_name>@<target hostname>:<path to target storage>
	
To copy from or to a local machine, the `user_name` and `hostname` details can 
be left blank. For example, if `user` was transferring `file.txt` from his local 
machine to his work directory on Roar Collab, the command would be:

	$ scp file.txt user@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/storage/work/user/

By default, 2FA will send a push notification to your mobile device.

### sftp

`sftp` is an interactive command that uses the same syntax as a standard 
command-line ftp client. It differs from a standard ftp client in that the 
authentication and the data transfer happen through the (encrypted) SSH protocol 
rather than the (not encrypted) FTP protocol.

The syntax for calling `sftp` is:

	$ sftp <user_name>@<hostname>

There are a number of basic commands that are used inside of `stfp`:

*   `put filename`: uploads the file filename
*   `get filename`: downloads the file filename
*   `ls`: lists the contents of the current remote directory
*   `lls`: lists the contents of the current local directory
*   `pwd`: returns the current remote directory
*   `lpwd`: returns the current local directory
*   `cd directory`: changes the current remote directory to directory
*   `lcd directory`: changes the current local directory to directory


To choose between different options for 2FA you have to set the port to 1022 
using P flag similar to `ssh`. 

### rsync

`rsync` is a utility that can be used to copy files and for keeping files the 
same on different systems as a rudimentary version control system. The benefit 
to using `rsync` over `scp` is that `rsync` will only copy the files that were 
not successfully synced or have been changed since the previous run. 

** NOTE: `rsync` should NOT be used with Nearline/archival storage. Doing so can
cause poor performance for all users. **

Using the `rsync` utility follows a similar format as `scp`. To transfer file(s) 
from a remote host to local storage:
`$ rsync <user id>@<host>:/path/to/source/file /path/to/target/file`

And to transfer files from local storage to a remote host:
`$ rsync /path/to/source/file <user id>@<host>:/path/to/target/file`

To transfer a local directory to Roar, the command would look like:
`$ rsync ./directory user_id@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/storage/work/user_id`

Helpful flags or options for `rsync` include:
 - `-a` : archive - allows synchronization of a complete directory
 - `-z` : compress - compresses the file(s) before transfer
 - `-P` : progress and partial - provides a progress bar and resumes any 
 previously interrupted transfers instead of deleting the partial file and restarting
 - `--delete` : remove any destination files that have been removed from the source
 - `--exclude` : excludes any files or directories specified in a comma-separated list
 - `--chmod` : changes file permissions on destination files once transfer is complete

## Drag and Drop Tools

WinSCP and FileZilla provide a free secure FTP (SFTP) and secure copy (SCP) 
client with graphical interface for Windows, Linux and Mac using SSH, allowing 
users to transfer files to and from our cluster file system using a drag-and-drop 
interface. 

When using these tools, please ensure you are using either the SCP or SFTP 
protocol to connect to the [Data Management nodes](#datamgr) using port 22.

For more information, please visit the [WinSCP homepage]
(http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or the [FileZilla homepage]
(https://filezilla-project.org/).  

You can see the connection process in this [ICDS tutorial video]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOJaKeA89lI&t=2s).

## Using Globus

Users can also use [Globus](http://globus.org/) for robust, user-friendly file 
transfers between Roar, Roar Collab, Nearline storage, and personal machines. 
Established Globus endpoints are available on ICDSâ€™s data manager nodes for 
optimized data transfer speeds.

ICDS offers the following endpoints for Globus users:

|Resource|File System Access|Endpoint Name(s)|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Roar|Scratch, Home, Work, Group/Active, Nearline|PennState_ICS-ACI_DTN_EndPnt_01|
|||PennState_ICS-ACI_DTN_EndPnt_02|
|||PennState_ICS-ACI_DTN_EndPnt_03|
|Roar Collab|Home, Work, Group/Active|PennState_ICDS_RC|

To transfer data between established endpoints, like those specified in the table 
above, please see [How to Login In and Transfer Files with Globus]
(https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/).

To transfer data to and from and a personal machine or lab server, please see
