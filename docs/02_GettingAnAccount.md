# Getting An Account




## PSU Affiliates

A user without access to Roar Collab (RC) can request an account by submitting an [account request](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup). An active Penn State access account is required to request an account on RC.


## Non-PSU Affiliates

For any external collaborators, a university faculty member must set up a [sponsored access account](https://security.psu.edu/services/penn-state-accts/sponsored) with the university Accounts Office to provide the collaborator with an access account. Once the collaborator access account is active, submit an [account request](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup) to RC.
