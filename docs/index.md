## Notation

Angle brackets around an `<item>` denote the need to replace the entire `<item>` with another string. The angle brackets should no longer be present after the replacement occurs.

Square brackets around an `[item]` denote an optional item. If used, the entire `[item]` should be replaced with a string, and the square brackets should no longer be present after the replacement occurs.

When commands are provided, they are typically provided with a leading prompt character. When the `$` prompt character is used, it denotes that the command is to be run within the system prompt. When the `>` prompt character is used, it denotes that the command is to be run within a software application's prompt.
