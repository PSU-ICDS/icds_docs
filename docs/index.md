Angle brackets around an **\<item>** denote the need to replace the entire **\<item>** with the string. The angle brackets should no longer be present after the replacement occurs.

Square brackets around an **[item]** denote an optional item. If used, the entire **[item]** should be replaced with a string, and the square brackets should no longer be present after the replacement occurs.
