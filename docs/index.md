# Notation

Angle brackets around an `<item>` denote the need to replace the entire 
`<item>` with the string. The angle brackets should no longer be present after 
the replacement occurs.

Square brackets around an `[item]` denote an optional item. If used, the entire 
`[item]` should be replaced with a string, and the square brackets should no 
longer be present after the replacement occurs.
