# Paid resources

All users are automatically provided a set number of [READ credits](read-credits.md) each month. 
For extended computing, ICDS offers paid compute in the form of credits and allocations. 
We also offer extended, group-level storage either mounted on the compute cluster or as an 
archive option.

## Compute offerings


**Credit accounts** are like Starbucks cards:  

- you only pay for what you use; 
- you can buy time on any type of hardware you need;
- but you must stand in line with other paying customers.

**Allocations** are like vacation time-shares:  

- you reserve time on specific hardware;
- you get prompt access to your resources; 
- but you cannot use hardware different from what you reserved,
- and you must pay whether or not you use the time.

With both credit accounts and allocations, 
PIs can manage the account, adding group members to the list of allowed users.

PIs can have multiple accounts and allocations, with different user lists, 
paid by different sources of funds, for different research projects.

## Storage offerings

Paid storage is available as group or archive storage.

**Group storage** is shared storage that is mounted to the cluster, meaning the files can 
be accessed and modified in place. This storage is intended for use within computing jobs 
and can be shared with a specified group of individuals.

Group storage membership can be managed by you through the use of [User Managed Groups](managing-storage.md).
or by requesting that members be added to the storage's collab group by emailing us at 
<icds@psu.edu>.

**Archive storage** is shared storage that is separate from the computing resource. This 
storage is intended for long term file storage and files need to be transferred out before 
they can be accessed or modified.

## Prices

Prices for different compute nodes are set proportional to the cost of the hardware,
and at a level competitive with the cost of buying your own cluster.
More expensive nodes cost more to use, reflecting their greater value.
