# READ credits (Open account)

Beginning January 2026, ICDS has replaced the historical Open Queue and now provides 
Research Exploration and Discovery (READ) Credits to all system users. READ credits include 
a moderate amount of credits for free to all system users. These credits will operate 
identically to paid credits and users can use them to run jobs on any 
[available hardware](../system/compute-hardware.md) using credit-compatible partitions.

Additionally, researchers can request additional READ credits through a lightweight 
application process.

!!! warning "General READ credits do not rollover"
    General READ credits (those offered to users on a monthly basis) do not rollover. Credit balances 
    reset at the start of each month and unused credits are lost.
    
    This does not apply to additional credits granted through the application process.
