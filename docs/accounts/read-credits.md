# READ credits

Beginning January 2026, ICDS has replaced the historical Open Queue and now provides 
Research Exploration and Discovery (READ) Credits to all system users. READ credits include 
a moderate amount of credits for free to all system users. These credits will operate 
identically to paid credits and users can use them to run jobs on any 
[available hardware](../system/compute-hardware.md) using credit-compatible.

Additionally, researchers can request additional READ credits through a lightweight 
application process.

For more information on READ credits, including how to request additional credits, please
